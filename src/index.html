        <h1>Share your home, nanny and costs</h1>
        <p>
          You have a fantastic home, a fantastic nanny and wouldn't cutting your costs in half be, well, fantastic?! If
          only it was easy to connect with other parents to share your costs? Well now it is, with Hapy! Hapu means
          tribe and it's our foundational 3 tribal principles that empowers you to create and manage your own tribe. A
          tribe that together has the power to create new affordable solutions in childcare that work for you and your
          community.

      <h1>Shared payments made simple</h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes it's hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill. Try sharing that bill week in, week out and you might
        encounter more than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates and our automated payment system
        takes care of the rest. You need never talk money or who owes what.

      <h1>A framework built for the long term</h1>
      <p>
        Childcare is for the long term. And you need a framework you can count on that gives your share long term
        viability and success. That's why we've defined Hapu around our three tribal principles: clearly defined
        process, transparency over money and equility of participation.
